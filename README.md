# ChatGPT prompt to generate a prompt
I want to develop and deploy a javascript web app that allows retailers to track income and expenses so they can know ehen they are making a profit or loss. The app uses various types of input, including photos and scanned documents, to help track income and expenses in real-time. More capabilities including allowing the retailers to record expenses and incomes when receipts or invoices or other documents are not available. Please develop a prompt that I can use with bolt.new or other AI tool so that it can develop this app for me.

# ChatGPT Output (tested with Rork.AI, Bolt.new, and Cursor.ai)
I want to build and deploy a full-stack JavaScript web app for retailers to track income and expenses in real-time so they can clearly know when they're making a profit or loss. The app should include the following features:

🎯 Core Features:
Dashboard to display profit/loss summary and graphs of income vs. expenses.

Ability to record income and expenses manually, including:

Date

Amount

Description

Category (e.g., utilities, sales, rent, etc.)

Ability to upload photos or scanned documents (receipts, invoices, etc.) and use OCR (optical character recognition) to extract relevant financial data (e.g., totals, vendor names, dates).

Support for manual entry when no receipts or documents are available.

📦 Tech Requirements:
Frontend: React.js or Vue.js with a clean and responsive UI.

Backend: Node.js with Express for APIs.

Database: MongoDB or Firebase for storing income/expense data, users, and uploaded documents.

Authentication: User login/signup with secure authentication (JWT preferred).

Image Uploads & OCR:

Integrate a third-party OCR service (e.g., Tesseract.js, Google Vision API) to extract data from uploaded images or PDFs.

📊 Additional Capabilities:
Auto-categorization suggestions based on extracted or typed data.

Export reports to PDF/CSV.

Mobile-friendly design.

Ability to filter income/expenses by date range, category, etc.

🔐 Optional:
Multi-user support (for shop assistants or business partners).

Role-based access control.

🛠️ Deployment:
Deploy using Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting for frontend.

Use Render, Railway, or Heroku for backend.

Please generate the codebase, file structure, and instructions for deployment. Make the system modular, scalable, and easy to maintain. Include comments in the code.

🧠 Tip:
If you're using bolt.new, paste the above prompt as your project brief. You can later refine it or ask for improvements (like adding expense graphs, notification reminders, or offline support).


## Bolt.new - couldn't fix errrors
## Rork.ai - Made the best app, I could not download the code without paying
## Cursor-ai - Successful, but struggling to debug (the app is ready, but I cannot register users. Potential problems: failing to connect with the back-end)
